# turnpike
My personal practice - it is nothing special at all.
echo "# turnpike" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/mecolli2/turnpike.git
git push -u origin master

I guess this is where I am going to write a bit about myself to practice editing a branch.
